## Project Idea

To improve the lives of Indian farmers by leveraging `Blockchain Technology`, `Machine Learning` and `Internet of Things`.

Indian farmers face numerous challenges, including:
* Unpredictable crop yields: Farmers often lack access to accurate information about weather, market conditions, and optimal crops for their land. 
* Exploitative market practices: Middlemen and intermediaries often take a large share of farmers' profits, leaving them with insufficient income.
  
## Our Approach
* **Gathering Data using NodeMCU:** With the present sensors the Temperature, Pressure, Altitude, and Moisture Data is gathered live. The data is processed to give produce calibrated readings.
* **Data Storage on Lighthouse:**
* **ML prediction**
## Challenges We Faced
Developing a project that comprises Blockchain, Machine Learning and the Internet Of Things does pose a challenge when integrating all three. Following are the challenges we faced:
- Blockchain
    - a
- Machine Learning
    - b
- IOT
    - Calibrating the sensors to get a reasonably accurate value.
    - Establishing wireless communication and sending data to the backend server. Also not exposing the backend IP properly on the local network resulted in further complications.
