Dead simple! A DAO for farmers.

## Project Idea

To improve the lives of Indian farmers by leveraging blockchain technology and machine learning.

Indian farmers face numerous challenges, including:

* Unpredictable crop yields: Farmers often lack access to accurate information about weather, market conditions, and optimal crops for their land.
  
* Exploitative market practices: Middlemen and intermediaries often take a large share of farmers' profits, leaving them with insufficient income.
